  description: "Born in the world of sprint canoeing, Mako was created with a clear goal in mind: offering trainers and athletes the data they need for optimising their performance"
  content: "It is impossible to fully characterise a training or a competition just by observing it: certain details such as subtle movements, heart rate or slow speed drifts will go unseen by the naked eye of a trainer. <br> In Mako, we develop software solutions that can process the raw data acquire by different sensors to offer trainers and staff the precise data they require for analysing the
    performance of an athlete."

  title: "DATA IS POWER"
  content: "Sensors give us the possibility of \"seeing the invisible\": by properly processing specific data and analysing trends, it's possible to gather information about an athlete's performance that otherwise would go completely unseen.


  In Mako, we believe that trainers should not be the ones to try to interpret raw data from sensors. It is because of this that we offer them state-of-the-art solutions that help them get both the cualitative and cuantitative results they require for analysing a recording.


  We believe in the one-to-one relationship with a team's technical staff in order to fully adapt the data acquisition and processing stages to the specific needs of their sport or athletes.
