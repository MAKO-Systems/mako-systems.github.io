#### 1. Why mako over other alternatives?

There is one key factor that differenciates us from our competitors: our focus on the athletes. 

Other companies take the raw data from the sensors, process it in a purely statistical way and leave the responsibility of interpreting the
results to the technical staff. In our case, we really want to retrieve useful results that trainers can directly use in their planifications 
with no previous "guessing game". For this purpose, we like maintaining one-to-one relationships with them in order to fully comprehend their
view of the sports and adapt the results output by our program to what they really need.

#### 2. What sports does Mako support?

For the moment, we are only providing full support for Canoeing (C1, C2 and C4). This is because this sport is where our
project started and the one we have been able to develop the most software for. It is expected to include Kayaking or Whitewater 
to this list in few months. 

Nevertheless, we really ant to expand to other individual sports. If you would be interested in this, please, contact us! We will
be so pleased to incorporate new modalities to our project.

#### 3. Does Mako collect any data?

Since we offer offline software solutions, Mako does not collect any data related to any of themeasurements taken! Both the
raw data from the sensors and the results obtained after the processing are kept private in the client's computer, and not
uploaded anywhere.

#### 5. Is there any security concern I should know?

Not at all! Once we give you the corresponding credentials for accessing the software, we will no longer have any access to any
of our programs. It is the responsibility of the client to keep his or her data safe.
